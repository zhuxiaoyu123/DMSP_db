Genes with related KO categories are annotated by KEGG [BlastKOALA](https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/).<br>

> ⚠️ **Note:** Although KofamScan may be more convenient for local analyses, its stringent thresholds can lead to fragmented proteins being missed, which are common in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. Based on my testing, *BlastKOALA* does not appear to have this issue and is therefore recommended.<br>

BCCT family transporter genes are identified by [TCDB](https://www.tcdb.org/).<br>
The remaining genes are identified by blasting against custom databases built with ratified sequences.
Using dddK as an example:
```bash
#blastp (identity >= 40%; query coverage >= 70%; subject coverage >= 50%)
diamond blastp \
  --db  dddK.dmnd\
  --query dddK.prefilter.faa \
  --out dddK.id40_cov70.out \
  --outfmt 6 \
  --max-target-seqs 1 \
  --id 40 \ 
  --subject-cover 50 \
  --query-cover 70

For DmdA-like, DddK, MddH, and TpMMT, a set of previously identified non-homologous was included as negative reference sequences in the BLASTP search to help distinguish true hits from closely related non-target genes.
```
> ⚠️ **Note:** DmdA was first identified in Ruegeria pomeroyi (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1130657) and is assigned to K17486. More recently, functional dmdA-like genes have been reported in SAR92 (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01467-23), as well as in Vibrio and Psychrobacter (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01806-21). The SAR92 dmdA-like sequences cannot be annotated by BlastKOALA, whereas the dmdA-like genes from Vibrio and Psychrobacter are assigned to K00605 (gcvT / AMT, glycine cleavage system T protein, aminomethyltransferase). Additionally, between the canonical DmdA clade and these newly reported dmdA-like sequences, the phylogenetic tree contains several previously described non-dmdA genes. These together indicate these newly reported dmdA-like sequences are substantially diverged from the canonical Ruegeria DmdA. Therefore, individual BLASTP screening are applied for these dmdA-like genes. <br>
